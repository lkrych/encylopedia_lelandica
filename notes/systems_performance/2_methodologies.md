## Introduction

When learning anything new, you need to learn what something is before you can start working it into your mental model of how things work. Computer systems are no different. You can graduate from school with a good understanding of how an operating system works, but where do you learn how to manage one? This is where experience comes in.

In systems performance, experience allows you to know which metrics are important and how to use them to narrow down an investigation. It is extremely hard to teach the hard-won knowledge of experience.

The solution to this problem is to teach **methodologies**: **strategies and mental models for approaching performance engineering**. These methodologies are the building blocks of all the tools that we will address in later chapters.

## Terminology

1. **IOPS** - **(Input/output operations per second)** is a measure of the **rate of data transfer operations**.
2. **Throughput** - The rate of work performed. Especially in communications, the term is used to refer to the data rate (bytes per second, etc.) 
3. **Response time** - **The time for an operation to complete**. This includes any time spent being serviced, includinng the time to transfer the result.
